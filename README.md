# Arweave File Upload Methods

This repository contains scripts for uploading files to Arweave using different methods available. Arweave is a decentralized storage platform that allows you to store data on a permanent and decentralized blockchain.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Yarn or NPM (Yarn is preferred)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory using the terminal/command prompt.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```
or

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

befor running any command, be sure to build the project with the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

### 1. Storing a Single File to Arweave

To store a single file on Arweave, use the following command:

```bash
yarn store-file <path_to_file>
```

Replace <path_to_file> with the path to the file you want to upload.

### 2. Storing Multiple Files as a Bundle to Arweave

To store multiple files as a bundle on Arweave, use the following command:

```bash
yarn store-bundle <path_to_file1> <path_to_file2> ... <path_to_fileN>
```

Replace <path_to_file1>, <path_to_file2>, etc., with the paths to the files you want to include in the bundle. The minimum number of files required for a bundle is two.

### 3. Using Bundlr to Store a Single File to Arweave
To store a single file on Arweave using the Bundlr library, use the following command:

```bash
yarn bundlr-store-file <path_to_file>
```
Replace <path_to_file> with the path to the file you want to upload.

### 4. Using Bundlr to Store a Bundle to Arweave

```bash
yarn bundlr-store-bundle <path_to_file1> <path_to_file2> ... <path_to_fileN>
```
Replace <path_to_file1>, <path_to_file2>, etc., with the paths to the files you want to include in the bundle. The minimum number of files required for a bundle is two.

### 5. Watching Transaction Status

```bash
yarn watch-tx <transaction_id>
```
Replace <transaction_id> with the ID of the transaction you want to monitor.

### 6. Generating a New Arweave Key Pair
To generate a new Arweave key pair, use the following command:

```bash
yarn generate-key
```

### 7. Getting the Public Address of an Arweave Key
To get the public address associated with an Arweave key, use the following command:

```bash
yarn get-public-key
```
## Configuration
Before running the scripts that interact with Arweave, make sure to configure your Arweave key by setting the ARWEAVE_KEY environment variable. You can do this by creating a .env file in the root of this repository and adding the following content:

```makefile
ARWEAVE_KEY=<your_arweave_key>
```
Replace <your_arweave_key> with your actual Arweave key in JSON format.
